<div class="block">The <code>AirlineAnalysis</code> class implements a simple information program for a 
 fictional airline. It is designed to be accessed by employees of the company, 
 who may pass some of the information on to customers when needed. It would
 show a menu that lists queries that the user may look for. Airlines data should
 be input from a file when the program begins. Output would be well formatted if
 valid infomation has been read from the input file.
 
  <p>
  This implementation uses simple graph algorithms. Graphs are represented as an
  adjacency list. The Edge will have multiple values (distance, price) and are  
  implemented as a single list of edges with two values each. The DirectedEdge have
  implemented as two separate lists of edges, one for distance and one for cost. 
        The cities names are stored in an arraylist. MST is using Prim’s algorithm. Dijkstra’s
  algorithm is applied for searching the shortest distance and shortest price paths.
  The shortest hops path use breadth-first search. 
  <p>
  It supports the following operations: Show a list of direct routes with distances and
  prices, display a minimum spanning tree for the service routes based on distances, 
  find shortest path based on total miles from the source to the destination, find
        shortest path based on price from the source to the destination, find shortest 
        path based on number of individual segments from the source to the destination, search 
  all trips whose cost is less than or equal to an amount entered by user, add a new 
  route to the schedule and remove existing route from the schedule.

<div class="block">This is the main program that contains a menu-driven loop that asks the user for any of the
  queries. It would first pass the arguement of input data file name to process. Once all the  
  data in the input file has been processed, it would output a menu that has queries labeled 
  from 0 to 9. Each query would meet different requirements of the project. User would have 
  to input the label number to start each query option. The output would be shown on the 
  command line in a clear and well-formatted manner.
 <p>
  Query labeled 8 would output the cheapest route from a source city to a destination city 
  through a third city. This meets one of extra credit options. 
 <p>
  Query labeled 0 would quit the program. Before quitting, all the routes would be saved back to
  the same file and format that they were read in from, but containing the possibly modified
  route information.</div>
