Does your program run without error?: Yes

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:




Additional comments to the grader:

To compile the project, do javac AirlineAnalysis.java. After running AirlineAnalysis.java, the command would show up a menu
which asks the user input for any of the queries. 

AirlineAnalysis.java has added a query to indicate the cheapest route from a source city to a destination city through a third
city as option 8. User would be able to find the cheapest path from A to B given a stop at C. This meets one of the extra credit
requirments.

Note that for query that requires user input city names, they have to be exactly same as the city name in the text file that 
has scanned (case sensitive). Otherwise it would keep ask you to enter until it is a valid city name. 

A notification would be shown in command if a route that you want to add to the graph is already existed.
A notification would be shown in command if a route that you want to delete from the graph does not existed.

For W section, I have written comments for AirlineAnalysis.java and the resulting API formatted as an .html file is located inside 
the api folder.
