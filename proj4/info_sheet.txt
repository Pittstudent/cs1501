Additional comments to the grader:

Paper for the W section is not included in the zip.

I have written a new SecureChatClient.java based on the primitive ImprovedChatClient.java as the client side of secure communications. 
Grader should run SecureChatServer.java and SecureChatServer.java after implementing Add128 and Substitute.
